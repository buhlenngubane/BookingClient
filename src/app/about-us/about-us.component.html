              These operational Law Enforcement Guidelines on data disclosure requests are addressed to Law Enforcement Authorities seeking information from Booking.com about its customers and/or business partners. 
              <br/><br/>
              Please note, any enquiry unrelated to a Law Enforcement Request will not receive a response. For any other matter please contact our Customer Service Department.

              <h2>Who is responsible for handling data disclosure requests?</h2><br/>

              <br/><br/>
               All data disclosure requests must be addressed to Booking.com B.V. even in the event Booking.com has a local entity in the country where the requesting Law Enforcement Authority is established. Booking.com only discloses data following a data disclosure request which is legally binding to Booking.com B.V. under Dutch laws. Exceptions are made for emergency situations. 
              <br/><br/>
               Local entities of Booking.com only provide an internal supporting role to and for the benefit of Booking.com B.V. and may not disclose data upon request of a Law Enforcement Authority. Moreover, local entities of Booking.com may not have full access to all information collected through the Booking.com online services. 
              
              <br/><br/>

                      </li>
                </ul> 
              </li>
              </ul>

               </li>
               </ul>
              Please be as specific as possible and remember that all data disclosure requests must be reasonable, proportionate and necessary for the stated purpose. 
              
              <br/><br/>
              
              What happens in an emergency situation? 
              <br/><br/>
              Booking.com B.V. will make exceptions to its normal data disclosure procedure, if Booking.com B.V. believes that an emergency situation (such as a terrorist act, serious harm to or death of a person) has occurred or may imminently occur if the requested information is not provided in a timely manner. 
              <br/><br/>
              Emergency Disclosure Requests must fulfill the following requirements:
              <ul> 
              <li> Address the request to Booking.com B.V., Herengracht 597, 1017 CE Amsterdam; 
              </li> 
              <li>Indicate that youâ€™re submitting an Emergency Disclosure Request; 
              </li>
              <li>Indicate the nature of the emergency situation (such as serious harm to or death of a person); 
              </li>
              <li>If possible, identify the (group of) person(s) in danger; 
              </li>
              <li>Specify which information is needed and why disclosure of data by Booking.com could (help to) prevent the emergency. Please be as detailed as possible; and 
              </li>
              <li>Include full contact details and signature of the submitting law enforcement officer, including a direct phone number. 
              </li>
              </ul>
              <br/><br/>
              
              Important Considerations
              <ul> 
              <li>The Booking.com Customer Service Team is not authorized to disclose any information by telephone or email outside of the process as explained in these Law Enforcement Guidelines. 
              </li>
              <li>Booking.com B.V. will not respond to correspondence sent to our employeesâ€™ corporate/personal email addresses. 
              </li> 
              <li>Booking.com B.V. will only respond to Law Enforcement Requests sent in accordance with these Law Enforcement Guidelines. 
              </li>
              <li>Booking.com B.V. has strict procedures in place for the protection of payment card data. Credit card details are generally hashed and therefore not readable 10 days after the reservation was made. 
              </li>
              <li>Booking.com B.V. reserves the right to notify its customers or accommodations when their personal data is being sought, except where providing such notice is prohibited by law.
